# Machine Learning Project: Finding the Higgs Boson

The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of physics which explains why other particles have mass. Since it decays rapidly, scientists do not observe it directly, but rather measure its decay signature. By applying binary classification techniques, using original data from CERN, we can predict whether the decay signature of a collision event was a signal from a Higgs boson, or something else.  

This is the aim of Project 1 in the Machine Learning course CS-433 at EPFL. The project description can be found in the PDF `project1_description.pdf`. 

## Getting Started

First, you should place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a `data` folder at the root of the project. 

## Scripts

#### `implementations.py` 

Contains bla bla

* 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
